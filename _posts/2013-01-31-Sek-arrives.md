Sek arrived today, the first full-time robotic member of Roboskel.

<!--more-->

Hardware-wise, Sek is featured and will support a wide range of
development and demonsration activities:

 * Hokuyo UTM 30LX laser range finder at the front
 * An array of eight sonar range finders around his body
 * An X-Box Kinect and an Andrea Superbeam mic mounted on a panning
   mast
 * Roboteq motor controller and odometry encoder
 * 6-axis IMU
 * Infrared range finders, located at the bottom of his hull, to
   detect stairs

As Sek is custom-made there is no ROS stack for him yet, and
developing one will be Roboskel's top priority at this stage.
