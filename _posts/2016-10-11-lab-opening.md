The Roboskel Lab is Roboskel's new home. The lab is a research space
simulating a home which is monitored by advanced robotic equipment.
At one end of the lab is the "living area", which simulates a
single-room studio with a kitchen area and dining table and a living
room area with couch, TV, and cupboards. At the other end is the
working area: a lab bench for working on the robots and desks for the
Roboskel group. The "living" area and the working area are connected,
but clearly separated. The Roboskel Lab facilitates dataset collection
and technology validation for robot scene understanding, focusing on
activities of daily living. It offers a realistic living environment
for collecting the data needed for the Radio action.
