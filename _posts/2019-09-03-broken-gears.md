Our robot Rulah is faced with various hardships every day. Since it is
an outdoor platform, the vibrations that motors receive daily are
numerous.

This resulted in problems with the motors. One problem that
was effectively tackled was the creation of new gears for the motors,
as the existing ones had been destroyed and the motors were out of
order. As the purchase of new gear was not feasible, they were
redesigned. The stages for the construction of new gears were 3. The
gear was originally designed in the Blender design program, then 3D
printing materials was investigated to make gears properly
manufactured and durable enough for motors. Finally the gear was
printed on 3D printing machines . The material used to print the gears
is PC- ABS. 

When a wheel motor from a robot breaks down, the first thing to do is
check every piece that makes it up to see if something is broken. In
the motors of our Rulah outdoor robot platform, the motor's internal
gears were corrupted, possibly by the daily outdoor vibrations. It is
usually not possible to replace these gears, so the next step is to
rebuild them. The following steps are suggested for rebuilding these
gears.

 * The dimensions of the gear that will be designed were first
   measured by another non-damaged gear

 * Subsequently a design program was selected for the design of the
   3D lines 
   
 * We chose Blender as the design program and we followed the steps as
presented in the video by Otvinta .

 * The next step after gear design is the right choice of material for
   3D printing
   
 * The first material test we did was the resin, but the resin gears
   were found to be not suitable for the motor as they were crushed
   during the first motor test.

 * The final and correct selection of the appropriate material was
made with the list below 3D printing materials.

 * The material we have selected is PC- ABS and is the most common
   material plastic automotive parts.
