Intelligent data acquisition and processing networks

The purpose of the "SYNAISTHISI" project was to research and build a
system that can seamlessly integrate heterogeneous sensor, processing
and actuator networks and provide a flexible yet extendable service
layer that can translate such networks (devices, sensors, machines,
humans, etc.) into reusable service components that are easily
"weaved" into applications.

For the scope of this project several application scenarios were
identified. Having realized the potentially significant benefits for
society, the industry and by association the wider economy, the
project aimed to address challenges such as scalability, energy
efficiency and enabling business models which are currently hindering
mass deployment and exploitation of Wireless Sensor Networks, M2M,
and IoT research.
