**Human-Robot Collaboration: human collaborator representation for robot
autononous decisions (HR-CHORRUS)** is a ‘Stavros Niarchos foundation’ industrial post-doc fellowship that aims at
developing methods for safe and fluent Human –Robot Collaboration. The project’s objectives are to
represent human collaborators within the environment, infer short-term human intentions based on
movement profile and decide on appropriate robot movements on collaborative tasks.
