to Hydra. The ROS nodes for his IMU and Roboteq motor controller were
developed by [Andreas]({% link _portfolio/98_alumni.md %}#lydakis).
His first task was collecting audio-visual and laser range data for
experiments on speaker diarization, cooperating with Theodoros
Giannakopoulos in the AVISPIRE project. He then helped
[Charalambos]({% link _portfolio/98_alumni.md %}#rossides)
