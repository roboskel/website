Raphaelo "Rapha" is the second turtlebot that joined Roboskel in the
29th of July 2016. He worked on the Horizon 2020 project
RADIO. He is Joe's upgrade, but he has not come out of the lab yet. He
is mostly used for testing and data collection. His most memorable
experience was in the summer of 2016 when he was used to record over
200 scenes of people participating in activities of daily living, to
finally create a 700GB dataset consisting of RGBD, laser and audio
data.

Rapha has the following hardware:

Kobuki

Intel NUC Mini-PC

Orbbec Astra Pro RGBD Camera

Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 Laser Scanner
