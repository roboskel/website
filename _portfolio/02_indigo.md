Indigo is a Neobotix ME-470. He was built in 2007 in the context if
FP6-IST Indigo. He originally worked at Hellenic Cosmos, the museum of
the Foundation of the Hellenic World. While at the museum, he
participated in several field trials and demonstrations where he was
introducing museum visitors to the buildings of the Ancient Agora of
Athens. Hellenic Cosmos was, at the time, showing an interactive 3D
reconstruction of the Agora, to which Indigo was offering an
introduction.

Since March 2011, Indigo is assigned to the Institute of Informatics
and Telecommunications, where he contributes to research on embodied
dialogue management and on robot perception. He worked together with
Theodoros Varvadoukas for Theodoros' BSc thesis on human recognition
from laser range data. He has also participated in the studens' visits
at the Institute of Informatics and Telecommunications during the 2012
edition of the NCSR summer school, when he used his museum guide
skills to show students around the Institute explaining the research
carried out by the different labs.
