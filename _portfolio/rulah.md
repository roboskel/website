Rulah is a DrRobot Jaguar 4x4 robot and the first female robot that
joined Roboskel in the 7th of January 2016. When she first arrived in 
our lab, Rulah was not ROS compatible. The included software offered only
monitoring and teleoperation capabilities. Her most memorable experience
was in the autumn of 2016 when for the first time she was fully ROS
compatible and she could autonomously navigate in our lab. Rulah's
functionalities continue to grow, with the ultimate plan of navigating
and exploring autonomously in outdoor and environments and rough terrain.

Rulah has the following hardware:
 * Intel NUC Mini-PC
 * Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 Laser Scanner
 * Camera
 * Garmin GPS
 * An extra myAHRS+ AHRS
