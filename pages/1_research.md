Roboskel pursues three main lines of research: 
 
1. Autonomous exploration and experimentation, for the purpose of adapting and
improving rough terrain traversability models. 
2. Understanding and interpreting the meaning of human
motion, as a means for safe and fluent human-robot collaboration, including physical interaction. 
3. Scene understanding, with an emphasis on understanding and interpreting human movement during activities of
daily living.
